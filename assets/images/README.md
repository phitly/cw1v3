This is a placeholder for image assets.

For a real implementation, you would place actual image files here.
You can replace this with any PNG/JPG images you prefer.

Suggested images:
- Light mode image (sun, bright colors)
- Dark mode image (moon, dark colors)

Currently the app uses Icons instead of image files for better cross-platform compatibility.
